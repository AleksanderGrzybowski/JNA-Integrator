# Numerical integration tool

This is a project made for 'Assembler Languages' course at the Silesian University of Technology. First made with ugly Swing UI, then switched to web-based.

Shiny things used:

* NASM, C, gcc, make
* Java, JNA, Spark (web), Guice, JUnit
* HTML/CSS/JavaScript, jQuery, function-plot, MathJax, Bootstrap, node, bower
* Git, IntelliJ, Gradle

Invoke `JAVA_HOME=/path/to/x86/jdk ./gradlew run`, this will download local Gradle, local node, local bower and install all dependencies. Server starts on port 4567.
